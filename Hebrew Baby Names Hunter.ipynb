    "### Introduction\n",
    "Judaism is one of the ancient and celebrated religions in the world. It stands out for its cultural richness and strong roots to its ancestors. The Jewish people - about whom Judaism is based on - are known for the strong adherence to traditions. (Reference - <a href = \"https://echoesandreflections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/01-02-03-03_StudentHandout_AboutJewsJudaism.pdf\">About Jews and Judaism</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is a demonstration of one of their rich tradition - naming. \n",
    "The Jewish naming culture follows a unique convention in which there exists a first name, one parent's Jewish name, an element to denote the gender('ben' for male and 'bat' for female), \"v'\", and the other parent's Jewish name. All the names are Hebrew names of characters from the Hebrew Bible. Also, in the modern world, Jewish unwilling to identify as a gender uses the term 'mibeit' which translates to ' from the house of' in place of 'ben' or 'bat'. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Examples</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Male name: <b>David ben Yosef v’Chanah</b> - David son of Joseph and Hannah\n",
    "\n",
    "Female name: <b>Leah bat Moshe v’Rachel</b> - Leah daughter of Moshe and Rachel\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-gender name: <b>Rivka mibeit Leah v’Rachel</b> - Rivka from the house of Leah and Rachel\n",
    "\n",
    "(Reference: <a href = \"https://reformjudaism.org/learning/answers-jewish-questions/what-proper-format-hebrew-names\">What Proper Format Hebrew Names</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of ethnic groups within Judaism depending on their geographic origin. In this work, four most popular ethnicities would be considered for naming. They are namely - Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrahi, and Ethiopian Israelis. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Ashkenazi</b> - roots from Germany and Eastern Europe \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Sephardic</b> - roots from Spain, the Iberian Peninsula and the Spanish Diaspora\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Mizrahi</b> - roots from Iraq, Persia (Iran), and Yemen. Now in Israel\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Ethiopian israelis</b> - roots from Ethiopia\n",
